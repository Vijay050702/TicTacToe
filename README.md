 🎮 **Tic Tac Toe Game**

This is a fully functional **Tic Tac Toe** game built in **Java** with a graphical user interface (GUI). Players can choose to play against another player or against an AI using the **Minimax algorithm**.

🧠 Features

* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Two-player mode
* 🤖 Single-player mode vs AI (Minimax)
* 🎨 User-friendly GUI using Java Swing
* ✅ Win/draw detection and replay option

* **Prerequisites**
* Java 8 or above
* Any IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans) or CLI

* **Running the Game**

1. Compile the code:
   javac TicTacToe.java
2. Run the program:
   java TicTacToe
   

 🛠️ How It Works

* Minimax AI: The computer calculates the best possible move by simulating every possible outcome, ensuring it never loses.
* Game Logic: Built-in logic handles turn-switching, move validation, and game-over conditions.
* GUI: Developed using Java Swing with buttons representing cells.
